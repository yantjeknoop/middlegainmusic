			<h2>Introducing myself</h2>
			<p> My name is Yannick Middelkoop, a 21 year old student residing in Geldermalsen, the Netherlands. Music is my passion and has taken over my life from a young age. I picked up my first guitar when 
			I was 9 years old and have been playing ever since. Very quickly I made the switch to electric guitar, which is my current favorite instrument. I started recording my own instrumental songs at age 15, with 
			just a direct input into a crappy pc. From that moment I knew music was going take over my life in some form. 
			</p>
			<h3>The Cashewnuts</h3>
			<p>In 2015, I joined a friend in his band, The Cashewnuts. A country/blues band consisting of 5 people. We had played a few gigs together and had a great time making music and hanging out. I realized the music
			world was a place I liked to be in. During my time with the band I bought my first audio interface and started recording songs more seriously. I noticed mixing and producing tracks was something I really like to 
			do. Unfortunately the band broke up and we parted our own ways. I continued to produce my own songs and told myself this is what I wanted to do for a living.
			</p>
			<h3>HKU and Middle Gain Music</h3>
			<p> In september 2016 I started on a preparatory training for a producer education at the Hogeschool voor de Kunsten in Utrecht. This course prepares me for a full time study on how to be a producer. The goal
			is to be allowed for the bachelor Composition and Production of Music. I also started my own company, Middle Gain Music, with plans to build a home studio. In this studio I produce my own music but also make 
			productions for other people. For more information on both, head over the the <a href="../pages/work.html">"Work"</a> page
